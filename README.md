Using Github, I was able to completed a few different courses such as First Day on Github and First Week on Github (pictured below). Both of these helped build a familarity with Github and understand how to create and manage pull requests, and how to create and host my own pages.

To practice the skills I learned in these courses, I created and maintained this technical skills resume on Github using markdown and html. This leveraged different skills such as html programming, uploading and inserting images, and commiting updates to the master branch. Most of my focus in creating this template was placed on taking the Jekyll template and customizing it. Github has a set of standard themes for webpages, so I was able to find the html file for the "architect" theme and make personal changes from there such as: adding my headshot and personal information to the sidebar, changing the default header (my repository name) to a customized title and subtitle, and formatting text within the body of the page.

Through the tutorial provided, I was able to deploy an Algo server, configure VPN clients, create/delete users, and set up a tunnel by using WireGaurd.</li>

I was able to take an online course using edX called Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI. It covered the topic list pictured below and taaught me how Power BI is used in the workplace and why it is such an important tool. I was able to figure out how to import data into Power BI and what the interface of the application looks like. After learning the basics, I was able to get in some real practice as well. The courses I completed are listed below. 
    
 <ul>
  <li>Managing Data Transformations on the PowerBI Desktop Application</li>
  <li>Desktop Modeling</li>
  <li>Data Visualizations</li>
  <li>Online PowerBI Service</li>
  <li>Excel Data Imports and Direct Connectivity</li>
</ul>

I also was able to do an analysis of my own called Retail Analysis and after going through all of the data provided, I came up with my own dashboard. Below is a link to a video that has a deeper explanaition for my Dashboard and why I did what I did.

<details><summary>Automation Anywhere</summary>
  

<ul>
<li> For this task I was able to take a closer look at robotic proces automation. I was able to learn about the different types of bots out there and the different use cases for each. Some of the other topics covered FEasibility Aanalaysis, ROI Analysis, and Bot Development. I never realized how much work is put into figuring out the requirments and justifications of a bot before it can be worked on</li>
  </ul>

  <li> This course also covered Robotic Process Management. The focus on this was mainly what it was like to be in charge of an RPA project. It talked about how a manager should be preparing for and understanding the needs of the project. It is very important to full understand what is being built and why it is necessary before any development can start. </li>
